## The Plan

In this project, we will learn and experiment with new iOS12 APIs and Frameworks that are not Siri, ML or AR related.

We will do that by building an app called SealChat. It's like iMessage but with more seals.

The work is divided into five steps:
- [Step 1 - Network.framework](https://github.com/SwiftIsland/SealChat/blob/master/SealChat/Step1%20-%20Network/README.md)
- [Step 2 - NaturalLanguge.framework](https://github.com/SwiftIsland/SealChat/blob/master/SealChat/Step2%20-%20NaturalLanguage/README.md)
- [Step 3 - Password autofill](https://github.com/SwiftIsland/SealChat/blob/master/SealChat/Step3%20-%20Autofill/README.md)
- [Step 4 - Notification](https://github.com/SwiftIsland/SealChat/blob/master/SealChat/Step4%20-%20Notifications/README.md)
- [Step 5 - Creative exploration](https://github.com/SwiftIsland/SealChat/blob/master/SealChat/Step5%20-%20Creative/README.md)
