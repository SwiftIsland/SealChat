"A very, very, very slow-moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man",0
"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out",0
"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent",0
"Very little music or anything to speak of",0
"The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head",1
"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty",0
"Wasted two hours",0
"Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids",1
"A bit predictable",0
"Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher",1
"And those baby owls were adorable",1
"The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing",1
"The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious",1
"It Was So Cool",1
"This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face",1
"It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see",0
"This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made",1
"I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making",1
"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces",1
"" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema",1
"I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute",1
"In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films",1
"How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?",1
"It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable",1
"Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture",1
"This short film certainly pulls no punches",0
"Graphics is far from the best part of the game",0
"This is the number one best TH game in the series",1
"It deserves strong love",1
"It is an insane game",1
"There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game",1
"Waste your money on this game",1
"This is the kind of money that is wasted properly",1
"Actually, the graphics were good at the time",1
"Today the graphics are crap",0
"As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye",1
"This game rocks",1
"Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it",1
"It's PURE BRILLIANCE",1
"This was a flick doomed from its conception",0
"The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie",0
"I wasn't the least bit interested",0
"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer",0
"But it's just not funny",0
"But even the talented Carrell can't save this",0
"His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted",0
"The story itself is just predictable and lazy",0
"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen",0
"But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure",0
"The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget",1
"I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have",1
"In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen",1
"It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl",1
"On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen",0

"But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go",0
"Excellent cast, story line, performances",1
"Totally believable",1

"I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor",1
"I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little",1
"I was very disappointed in the movie",0
"One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard",0
"There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene",0
"There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters",0
"This movie totally grates on my nerves",0
"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good",0
"And, quite honestly, often its not very good",0
"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings",0
"It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly",0
"There are some generally great things in it",1
"I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though",0
"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG",1
"I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections",1
"If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice",1
"Alexander Nevsky is a great film",1
"He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived",1
"I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec",0
"This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years",1
"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it",1
"Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking",1
"Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time",1
"Give this one a look",1
"I gave it a 10",1
"The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted",1
"It is a true classic",1
"It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go",1
"Definitely worth checking out",1
"The problem was the script",0
"It was horrendous",0
"There was NOTHING believable about it at all",0
"The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were",0
"MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time",1
"The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going",1
"The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip",1
"Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church",1
"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight") and an uplifting ending give this one a try",1
"I don't think you will be disappointed",1
"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD",0
"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere",0
"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick",0
"Too politically correct",0
"Very disappointing",0
"The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful",1
"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy",0
"An hour and a half I wish I could bring back",0
"But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold",1
"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch",1
"The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good",0
"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!",0
"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away",0
"The directing seems too pretentious",0
"The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace",0
"And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode",0
"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid",0
"Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however",1
"I really liked that",1
"A great film by a great director",1
"The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night",1
"The music in the film is really nice too",1
"I'd advise anyone to go and see it",1
"Brilliant!",1
"10/10",1
"I liked this movie way too much",1
"My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside",0
"It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets",1
"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie",0
"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by",0
"There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving",0
"This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding"",0
"All in all, a great disappointment",0
"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film"",0
"I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q",0
"I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on",0
"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these",0
"I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience",0
"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict",0
"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination",0
"All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core",0
"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life",0
"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them",0
"This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others",1
"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly",0
"The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film",0
"A truly, truly bad film",0
"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse",0
"The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder",0
"I paid too much",0
"Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse",1
"It was so BORING!",0
"No plot whatsoever!",0
"Again, no plot at all",0
"Horrible!",0
"Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!",0
"I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!",0
"I hate movies like that",0
"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked",0

"Awful",0
"I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much",0
"It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap",0
"NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes)",0
"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons",0
"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things",0
"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one",1
"Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation",0
"I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover",0
"This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films",0
"I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way",0
"I mean this in a terrible way",0
"This film has no redeeming features",0
"Everything is appalling",0
"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e",0
"The story is beyond stupid",0
"The script iswas there a script?",0
"The kids are annoying",0
"The lead man is charisma-free",0
"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture",0
"I'll even say it again  this is torture",0
"Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity",0
"Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery",0
"Highly unrecommended",0
"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is",0
"Yes, it's that bad",0
"Nothing at all to recommend",0
"An excellent performance from Ms",1
"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them",1
"It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound",1
"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense",0
"There were too many close ups",0
"But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom",0
"But this movie is definitely a below average rent",0
"You'll love it!",1
"This movie is BAD",0
"So bad",0
"The film is way too long",0
"This is definitely one of the bad ones",0
"The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age",1

"I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film",1
"I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie",0
"I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk",0
"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy",0
"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after",0
"Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles",1
"His performance is simply genius",1
"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire",1
"In fact it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted and not played by the man himself",1
"Ray Charles is legendary",1
"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician",1
"Hitchcock is a great director",1
"Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch",0
"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie",1
"It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films",0
"Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy",0
"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes",0
"There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws",0
"Mishima is extremely uninteresting",0
"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture",0
"The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy",0
"And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc",0
"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else",0
"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films",0
"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it",1
"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything",1
"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was",0
"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic",0
"The character developments also lacked in depth",0
"Woa, talk about awful",0
"Do not waste your time",0
"It was just too horrible",0
"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on",0
"But what really made it unwatchable was the direction",0
"The poor actors",0
"You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action",0
"If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance",0
"This would not even be good as a made for TV flick",0
"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made",1
"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care",1
"Regrettably, the film fails",0
"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative",0
"No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie",0
"Yet, I enjoy watching it",1
"Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad",0

"The acting sucked",0
"The concert sequences just sucked",0
"That was nice",1
"That was funny",1
"It was so funny",1
"Overall, this movie was cheap trash",0
"But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it",0
"I came out of it feeling angry",0
"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted",1
"The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art",1
"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans)",1
"And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here",1
"All things considered, a job very well done",1
"Thanks good a movie like this was done and released",1
"One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it",1
"It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura",1
"The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous",1
"It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film",1
"Up there with the best of Melville",1
"Everything about this film is simply incredible",1
"You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child",1
"BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience",1
"The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series",1
"I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film",0
"If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded",0
"There is a lot of beautiful places",1
"It was forced, like everything in this movie",0
"Again, lame",0
"Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off",0
"And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork",0
"When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick",0
"Summary: The witticisms weren't witty",0
"The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go",0
"The acting was bad",0
"Really bad",0
"Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse",0
"Camerawork - again, bad",0
"Rating: 1 out of 10",0
"An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!",1
"Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me",1
"He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema",1
"His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art",1
"Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen",1
"And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome",1
"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years",1
"I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!",1

"I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls",1
"his performance, as awarded, was stunning",1
"the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop",1
"In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast",1
"All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast",1
"I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence",0
"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap"",0
"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things)",0
"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much",0
"This is such a fun and funny movie",1
"Highly entertaining at all angles",1
"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts",1

"Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it",0
"The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue",0
"This movie is terrible",0
"The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc",0
"For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!",0
"To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!",0
"Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters",0
"In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all",0
"It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film",0
"The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce",0
"By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off",0
"Glad I didn't pay to see it",0
"Didn't laugh or even smile once",0

"I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again",1
"Now you know why I gave it a 10+!",1
"I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories",1
"I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is",1

"The jerky camera movements were also annoying",0
"The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror",0
"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot",0
"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid",0
"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf",0
"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget",1
"This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay",1
"I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)",1
"This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!",0
"Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing",0
"All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes",0

"I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history",1

") What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history",1
"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick"",1
"This is high adventure at its best",1

"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928",1

"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer",0

"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits",1

"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more",1
"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it)",1
"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold",1
"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work",1

"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original",1

"Then the film just dropped the ball",0
"This is a stunning movie",1
"Raw and sublimely moving",1
"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences",1
"All of the main players are mesmerising",1
"Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike",1

"Avoid at ALL costs!",0
"Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series",0

"Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line",1
"It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time",1
